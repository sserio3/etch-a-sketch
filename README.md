# Etch-a-Sketch

A web-based Etch-a-Sketch–style drawing app built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. This project focuses on JavaScript DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic layout generation using CSS Grid.

## Project Goals

- Build a sketchpad where the user can draw by hovering over a grid of squares.
- Allow the user to define the size of the grid (e.g., 16x16, 64x64).
- Apply color to each square when hovered.
- Include a button or UI element to reset or clear the grid.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (Grid)
- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation)
